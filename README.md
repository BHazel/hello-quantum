# Hello, Quantum!

Quantum computing is an exciting new field in computer science based on the science of quantum mechanics.  At present the field is at a similar place classical computing was in the 1940s and 1950s where we are currently manipulating individual bits (or "qubits") of data but the research is very fast-paced.

This repository contains code examples covering quantum computing concepts and processes.  Each example is written in a selection of platforms available from the rapidly growing number of organisations in the field and I intend to add more as the field and platforms develop.

I decided to create this repoistory as an exercise to help develop my own skills in the field of quantum computing and wanted to share this with the world.  I hope you find it useful!
