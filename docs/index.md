# Hello, Quantum!

Quantum computing is an exciting new field in computer science based on the science of quantum mechanics.  At present the field is at a similar place classical computing was in the 1940s and 1950s where we are currently manipulating individual bits (or "qubits") of data but the research is very fast-paced.

This web site contains code examples of quantum computing concepts and processes.  Each example is written in a selection of platforms available from the rapidly growing number of organisations in the field and I intend to add more as the field and platforms develop.  Accompanying the examples are explanations covering the scientific and mathematical background to add clarity.

I decided to create this web site, and its backing repository, as an exercise to help develop my own skills in the field of quantum computing and wanted to share this with the world.  I hope you find it useful!
