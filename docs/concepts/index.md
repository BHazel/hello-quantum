# Concepts

The samples in this category cover core concepts of quantum computing.

Sample | Description
--- | ---
[Superposition](superposition/code-samples.md) | Create a superposition between the $\|0\rangle$ and $\|1\rangle$ states for a single qubit and measure it.
[Interference](interference/code-samples.md) | Creates a superposition and applies interference to a qubit.
[Measurement Bases](measurement-bases/code-samples.md) | Create a superposition and measure it using different bases.
[Phase Kickback](phase-kickback/code-samples.md) | Apply a controlled-NOT gate to two qubits in the $\|+\rangle$ and $\|-\rangle$ superposition states to cause phase kickback.
[Entanglement](entanglement/code-samples.md) | Entangle two qubits and measure them.
